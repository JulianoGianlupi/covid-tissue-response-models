#Preliminary Results Set 1

This directory contains results from ten runs of a model parameter set, 
including global metrics defined by J. Aponte-Serrano, T.J. Sego, J.F. Gianlupi, 
J. Osborne, L. Brusch, and J.A. Glazier to characterize the resultant tissue 
dynamics of viral infection emerging from cellular- and subcellular-level 
model processes. Results were generated using the model state at 
[commit 1c2e31c7c47bf7761998e46f25d159b0bbd5561e](https://github.com/covid-tissue-models/covid-tissue-response-models/commit/1c2e31c7c47bf7761998e46f25d159b0bbd5561e). 
Model parameters can be found in `CoronavirusModelParams.csv`.
