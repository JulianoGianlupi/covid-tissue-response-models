Covid-19 Model Repository
=========================

This repository hosts variety mathematical models that focus on improving our understanding of how 
COVID-19 (and related viruses) affect tissues and how to determine optimal therapeutic intervention 
targets in a rational manner.

We invite the scientific community to contribute models that can be shared and disseminated in an 
open fashion so that they can reach target audience as fast as possible.


Shared and reproducible models
===============================

All models contributed to this repository are shared freely.
